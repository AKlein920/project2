GA WDIR Project 2


MUST FIX
- when you delete a user, their cheerups still remain
- character limit on body seemingly not working
- visualmedia vs. img OR iframe in schema
- when logged in, the 'register' link shouldn't show; 'log out' link should show


TO WORK ON
- showing all cheerups of a certain keyword
- showing a random cheerup's show page ('inspire me button')
- password encryption
- log in with Facebook/Google
